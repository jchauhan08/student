# 🛠️ Windows (WSL) Operating System and Tools Setup

Welcome! This guide will help you set up your development environment using **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** with **Ubuntu**, along with useful tools like Git and VS Code.

---

## 📌 What You’ll Learn

- Installing WSL and Ubuntu
- Setting up developer tools
- Using Linux commands
- Working with Git (version control)
- Installing packages using apt
- Getting started with Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

---

## 🧠 Visual Workflow Overview

Here’s a simple step-by-step visual of how everything fits together:

```
💻 Open Windows Terminal
💻 Install WSL → wsl --install
💻 Launch Ubuntu Terminal → wsl
📁 Linux Commands → mkdir, cd, ls
📁 Clone Project → git clone https://...
🛠️ Activate Tools → Ruby, Python, Git
🔄 Work Cycle → code → make → test → commit
```



## 🧰 Windows Setup

### ✅ Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download the installer for **Windows**
3. Install it using the default options

### ✅ Install Git Credential Manager (GCM)

1. Download from [https://aka.ms/gcm](https://aka.ms/gcm)
2. Run the installer and select default options


## 🐧 WSL Setup (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### 💾 Install WSL and Ubuntu

1. Open **Windows Terminal** and pin it to your taskbar
2. Run this command to install WSL with Ubuntu 24.04:

    ```bash
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
    ```

    When asked, create a username and password

    > **Note:** When typing the password, nothing will show—this is normal.

3. Once Ubuntu starts, exit the terminal:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

4. Set Ubuntu 24.04 as default:

    ```bash
    wsl --set-default Ubuntu-24.04
    ```

5. To reopen Ubuntu later, just run:

    ```bash
    wsl
    ```


### 🛠️ First-Time Ubuntu Setup

Open Ubuntu by right-clicking the terminal and choosing Ubuntu 24.04

Run these commands to set up your dev environment:

```bash
mkdir opencs
cd opencs
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program Files/Git/mingw64/bin/git-credential-manager.exe"
git clone https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/student.git
cd student/
./scripts/activate_ubuntu.sh
./scripts/activate.sh
./scripts/venv.sh
```

These scripts will ask for your WSL password, GitHub username, and email.
