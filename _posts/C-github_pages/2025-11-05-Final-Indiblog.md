# Reflecting on My Computer Science Journey

## Growth from the Beginning of the Year

Looking back at where I started this year, I've grown significantly in how I approach challenges. I've learned to **fail fast** - instead of spending endless hours trying to make something perfect, I now experiment quickly, learn from what doesn't work, and move on. I've become more **patient** with the learning process, understanding that mastery takes time. Most importantly, I've shifted my mindset to actively **look for solutions** rather than dwelling on problems. When something breaks or doesn't work, I now ask "how can I fix this?" instead of getting stuck on "why isn't this working?"

## Key Takeaways from the Past 3 Sprints

### Tools: Setting Up for Success

This trimester, I got a new computer and had to set everything up from scratch. Instead of seeing it as a setback, I turned it into an opportunity to **gamify my tool setup**. I challenged myself to see how quickly I could get my development environment running, and I took part in some incredible hacks along the way. Having the right tools configured efficiently has made such a difference in my productivity - what used to take me 20 minutes now takes 10.

### Lessons: The Art of Teaching

When it came time to give lessons to the class, I learned that **the hook is everything**. You have to grab people's attention in the first 30 seconds or you'll lose them. I focused on making lessons quick and engaging, spending less time on lengthy explanations and more time on **hands-on classwork**. People learn by doing, not by watching someone talk for 30 minutes. The feedback I got showed that interactive lessons stick way better than passive ones.

### Digital Famine & N@tM: Finding Inspiration

The Digital Famine experience and Night at the Museum were eye-opening. Seeing what other people created was **genuinely inspiring** - the creativity and technical skill on display pushed me to think bigger about my own projects. I also learned the value of **giving constructive feedback**. When you're thoughtful about what you share with others about their work, it helps both them and you think more critically about design and implementation choices.

## What I Want to Learn Next in CompSci

Moving forward, I have some clear goals for how I want to improve my collaboration skills:

- **Stop latching onto each other** - I've noticed our group tends to work too closely together sometimes, which means we're not covering as much ground as we could
- **Talk across the table** - Communication shouldn't just be with the person next to you. We need to get better at sharing ideas with the whole team
- **Don't let people take over** - I want to be more conscious about making sure everyone's voice is heard and no single person dominates the direction of a project

## MCQ Reflections

Working through the multiple-choice questions has been valuable practice. My strategy now is to **answer all the ones I know first**, then systematically **research the ones I don't**. This approach helps me build on my strengths while identifying specific gaps in my knowledge that I need to address.
# MCQ Topics Study Guide - Visual Summary

| **Topic** | **Category** | **Difficulty** | **What It Means** |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Citizen Science | Data & Society | ⭐⭐ | Scientific research conducted by the public (non-scientists). Examples: tracking bird migrations, classifying galaxies. Tests understanding of crowdsourcing data collection, benefits (large datasets, diverse locations) and limitations (data quality, bias). |
| Spinner with Unequal Sections | Simulation | ⭐⭐⭐ | Simulating probability with weighted outcomes. If sections are 50%, 30%, 20%, generate random numbers (1-100) and map to ranges: 1-50 = A, 51-80 = B, 81-100 = C. Key: cumulative probabilities. |
| Robot Algorithms Comparison | Algorithms | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Analyzing movement sequences (MOVE_FORWARD, ROTATE_LEFT) to determine which algorithm navigates robot to goal. Trace step-by-step, check if robot reaches goal without hitting obstacles. |
| Redundant Routing (4 Computers) | Networks | ⭐⭐⭐ | How many connections needed between 4 computers so if one fails, all can still communicate. Key: multiple paths must exist between any two nodes. Need at least 4 connections for fault tolerance. |
| String Replacement (TH/IS) | Algorithms | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Shortening text by replacing patterns. **Order matters!** "THIS" → Replace TH first: "?IS" → "??". Replace IS first: "TH?" → "??". Different paths, potentially different results. |
| Robot Code - IF Statement | Programming | ⭐⭐⭐ | Completing conditional logic for robot navigation. What condition triggers turn/move? What happens if true vs false? Trace step-by-step. Common: CAN_MOVE(direction), GOAL_REACHED(). |
| Smartphone Data Graph | Data Analysis | ⭐⭐ | Reading/interpreting graphs showing usage, sales, features over time. Look for: trends, comparing variables, max/min values, understanding axes. Practice bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots. |
| Loop Algorithms with Robots | Algorithms | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Comparing REPEAT, REPEAT UNTIL, FOR loops with robot movement. How many times does loop execute? What's ending position? Does it reach goal? Trace each iteration. |
| Computing Average from List | Programming | ⭐⭐⭐ | Comparing code segments calculating average. Pattern: sum = 0, loop adding elements, divide by length. Watch for: off-by-one errors, incorrect initialization, wrong divisor. |
| Frequent Customers (Snack Bar) | Data Analysis | ⭐⭐⭐ | Analyzing purchase data to identify most frequent customers. May involve: counting occurrences, sorting by frequency, filtering by threshold. Focus on data structures (lists, dictionaries). |
| Midterm/Final with MAX | Programming | ⭐⭐⭐ | Using MAX procedure to find highest score between midterm and final. Key: procedure calls, return values, variable assignment. Example: `score ← MAX(midterm, final)` returns larger value. |
| Runtime of Algorithm | Efficiency | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | How long algorithm takes as input grows. Categories: O(1) constant, O(n) linear, O(n²) quadratic. For retailers: searching, sorting, recommendations. Nested loops = slower, single pass = faster. |
| 4-Bit Integer Representation | Binary | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | How integers stored in binary with 4 bits. Can represent 0-15 (unsigned) or -8 to 7 (signed). Key: overflow (exceeding max), range limitations, binary↔decimal conversion. |
| 75% Success Experiment | Simulation | ⭐⭐⭐ | Simulating experiments with given success probability. Generate random 1-100: if ≤75, success; if >75, fail. Run multiple trials, count successes. Focus on correct probability mapping. |
| isPrime Procedure | Programming | ⭐⭐⭐ | Using isPrime(n) that returns true if n is prime, false otherwise. Uses: filtering primes from list, counting primes in range, checking conditions. Primes: divisible only by 1 and themselves (2,3,5,7,11...). |

## Something Cool I Liked

The hands-on hacks have been my favorite part of this course. There's something incredibly satisfying about building something that actually works - seeing your code come to life and solve a real problem. The **practical, project-based approach** has made computer science feel less like abstract theory and more like a creative tool I can use to build anything I can imagine. I also really enjoyed when I was with my Computer Crashers team and made the interactive Maze game and expanded on it.
